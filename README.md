# Adaptive LLM Switching Agent  

An experimental framework for **dynamic Large Language Model (LLM) routing**.  
Instead of relying on a single model for every task, this agent **intelligently switches** between a lightweight model (fast, cost-efficient) and a larger model (accurate, reasoning-heavy) — depending on context, latency, and prompt length.

## Features  

- **Adaptive Routing** – Switch between small (e.g., DistilGPT2) and large (e.g., Mistral-7B Instruct) models.  
- **Low Latency Mode** – Use the smaller model for fast responses.  
- **High Accuracy Mode** – Trigger larger models for complex prompts.  
- **Configurable Thresholds** – Adjust latency, prompt length, and concurrency limits.  
- **Simple Setup** – Designed to be lightweight and easy to extend.
